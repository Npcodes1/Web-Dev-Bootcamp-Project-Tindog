# TinDog Project

This is a website I am working on in my Udemy 2023 Web Development Bootcamp to learn more about incorporating BootStrap. The website was inspired by Dr. Angela Yu as a Tinder site but for dogs.

A skeleton project with all the graphics and some skeleton HTML was already created to be used to work with. I renamed it skeleton file to prevent confusion from my working HTML file that's index.html.
